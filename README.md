Alloverse's network API. It can be used as:

* **a window manager API**, when by appliances to present its UI to a place's
  inhabitants, and get callbacks when users interact with it;
* **a game engine network API**, when used by visors to read the environment
  and inhabitants of a place in order to visualize it on a user's screen/headset;
* **a game engine server API**, when used by placeserv to manage clients and the
place's environment and inhabitants.

The API is in C, and bridged into C# and Erlang.
