# allonet

[![Build Status](https://dev.azure.com/alloverse/allonet/_apis/build/status/alloverse.allonet?branchName=master)](https://dev.azure.com/alloverse/allonet/_build/latest?definitionId=1?branchName=master)

Alloverse's network API. It can be used as:

* **a 3D UI API**, when by appliances to present its UI to a place's
  inhabitants, and get callbacks when users interact with it;
* **a window manager API/game engine client API**, when used by visors
  to read the environment and inhabitants of a place in order to visualize
  it on a user's screen/headset;
* **a game engine server API**, when used by placeserv to manage clients and
  the place's environment and inhabitants.

## Using from different languages

Since allonet is written in C, its native API is C headers located in `include/allonet`.

For information about specific language bridges, see the README files in the `lang`
folder (both source and binary distributions).

For C#, the bridge is in the old `allovisor` repo for now. The Erlang bridge is
in the `alloplace` repo. Both will be moved to this repo.

## Download allonet

If you don't want to build allonet from source (as per "Developing allonet" below),
you can [download a binary distribution from Azure 
Pipelines](https://dev.azure.com/alloverse/allonet/_build?definitionId=1). Select
the latest pinned build, click the "artifacts" button, and download for the platform
you want to use. All language bindings are available in each platform download.

## Developing allonet

Allonet uses Cmake to generate its build files. To build using Make on a Unix/Mac machine,
do:

1. `mkdir build; cd build`
2. `cmake ..`
3. `make`

This will build allonet binaries. You could try out `build/allodummyclient alloplace://nevyn.places.alloverse.com`
to make sure it works.

To develop using e g Xcode, you can just supply `-G` to Cmake.

1. `mkdir xcbuild; cd xcbuild`
2. `cmake -G Xcode ..`
3. `open *.xcodeproj`

The same applies to Visual Studio, etc...

Visual Studio Code has great Cmake plugins, so you can just automate the above process
and just click "build" in the UI.

### Developing for Android

1. Install Android Studio, ?? SDK, ?? NDK.
2. `mkdir build; cd build`
3. `cmake -DCMAKE_TOOLCHAIN_FILE=~/Library/Android/sdk/ndk-bundle/build/cmake/android.toolchain.cmake -DANDROID_ABI=arm64-v8a ..`.
   Path to android toolchain file may be different on your system (e g if you're running Linux or Windows).
4. `make allonet`


### Notes for specific languages

Lua: `lib/lua` must be point at 5.1 to be luajit compatible. (Alloverse Visor uses LÃ–VR which uses luajit).

## Progress

So far, extremely rudimentary. Todo in order of priority:

- [x] Switch out manual arrays for libsvc
- [x] Basic Server implementation on enet
- [x] Basic Client implementation on enet
- [x] C# bridge and integrate with Unity visor
- [x] Erlang bridge and make sure server API fits mm pattern
- [x] Move to component based entities
- [x] Flesh out intents (head and hands, pointing, clicking)
- [x] Lua bridge and integrate with Lovr visor
- [ ] Assets (geometry, textures, animations)
- [ ] Static geometry (i e the place's environment)
- [ ] Manipulation intents (grabbing, throwing, menuing, ...)
- [ ] ACLs
- [ ] Avatar (specify asset for entity, and then animate/manipulate it)
- [ ] Multiple entities per client
- [ ] Move from enet to webrtc data channels
- [ ] Audio channels
- [ ] Video channels
